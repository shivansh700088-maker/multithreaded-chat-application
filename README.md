# Multithreaded Chat Application (Java)

## Overview
This project is a multithreaded client-server chat application developed using Java sockets.  
It allows multiple users to connect to a central server and communicate in real time.

The server handles multiple clients concurrently using threads and broadcasts messages to all connected users.

## Features

- Multi-client support using multithreading
- Real-time messaging
- Username identification
- Client join and leave notifications
- Client-server architecture
- Concurrent communication handling

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Socket Programming
- Multithreading
- Networking

## Project Structure

Server.java  
ClientHandler.java  
Client.java  

## How to Run

### Compile

### Start Server

### Start Client (in new terminals)


## Architecture
- Server listens for incoming client connections
- Each client connection runs on a separate thread
- Messages are broadcast to all connected clients
- Server manages active client list

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of socket programming
- Thread management and concurrency
- Client-server communication
- Network-based application development
